The model is trained with a constant speed but shows a greater performance upto 184% of the trained speed.

the weights and bias are stored in this model 

the game,brain has 2 different python files

this model is developed from tflearn inputdata model

trained with 4 input datas:
1)  x point if the player
2)  x from the center of the game_display
3)  x point of the obstracles
4)  y point of the obstracles


the model is trained with 12K training samples
it is an example of Supervised machine learning

these 12K samples are the data collected from my playing
